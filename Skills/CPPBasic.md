[Difference between Const and Static](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2216239/what-is-the-difference-between-a-static-and-const-variable#:~:text=The%20short%20answer%3A,once%20before%20the%20program%20startup.): 
The short answer:  
A const is a promise that you will not try to modify the value once set.  
A static variable means that the object's lifetime is the entire execution of the program and it's value is initialized only once before the program startup.
